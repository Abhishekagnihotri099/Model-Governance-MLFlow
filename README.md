# Model-Governance-MLFlow

You are working within a finance firm as a data scientist. You are responsible for training and 
deploying the models that you create. As is often the case you are a part of the team that work 
towards the same goals. This creates a need to be able to collaborate with each other within the 
team and organization to quickly iterate. 

Training multiple models often leads to the need of managing and organizing the results, 
hyperparameters and storing the models. As you are a part of the team working in the same 
direction, it necessitates the need for transparency within the team to see which model 
everyone is trying, what works and what does not. 
To solve these requirements, the organization has decided to use MLFlow for all the data 
science teams. This will help them collaborate and iterate quickly, trying to solve a particular 
problem. 

You are working with the loan default dataset which has the following columns :-
● LoanID - The loan ID
● Age - The age of the applicant
● Income - The income of the applicant
● LoanAmount - The total loan amount
● CreditScore - The credit score of the applicant
● MonthsEmployed - How many month has the applicant been employed
● NumCreditLines - How many credit lines
● InterestRate - The interest rate of the loan
● LoanTerm - The term of the loan
● DTIRatio - The debt-to-income ratio (DTI) ratio
● Education - The education level of the applicant
● EmploymentType - The employment type of the applicant
● MaritalStatus - The marital status of the applicant
● HasMortgage - If the applicant has mortgage or not
● HasDependents - if the applicant has dependents or not
● LoanPurpose - The purpose of the loan
● HasCoSigner - If cosigner exists
● Default - Did the applicant default
With the help of this dataset, you are to try to make the best loan default model possible, all the 
while tracking your models, experiments etc.
